# Zeros do Count

Having an arrays of numbers, place all zeros to the left of the array (if any).
The operation must preserve the existing relative order between the numbers.

Extra:
Solve this problem is to solve it in-line (without any extra arrays) 
and in a single iteration (only one for).
Otherwise, give a demonstration that this is not possible.

## Input 
An integer array. The size of the array can be 0 to 100,000.

Example:

```
Case 1:
1 0 3 4 0 2 0 0 1
```

## Output

An integer array with all zeros at the beginning.

```
0 0 0 0 1 3 4 2 1
```
